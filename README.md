fresh_style
===========

a fresh style for 4chan that makes liberal use of flexboxes 


how to use
==========

* you will need [this](https://github.com/offlineric/4chan-x/raw/master/builds/4chan-X.user.js) version of 4chan x which accomodates styling the removal of elements from the document.
* if you want to see exactly what I've done, you can check the changelog [here](https://github.com/offlineric/4chan-x/commit/ce045fd2642d7c758fd6e99d1ca8ac1783c6a219) 
* along with the [userscript](https://github.com/offlineric/fresh_style/raw/master/fresh_style.user.js) in this repo
* and the [stylesheet](https://github.com/offlineric/fresh_style/raw/master/fresh_style.user.css) 
* None of this is really optional in its current interdependent state.
* and the fonts lol.ttf, and foxy.ttf  if you want working icons for backlinks and menu buttons because i used them
* you should probably have droid sans as well.
* also don't forget to take a peek at line 9 so you can personalize your name and avatar ;)
